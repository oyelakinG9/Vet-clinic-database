# VET CLINIC
> Vet clinic project based on the POSTGRE SQL DATABASE (STRUCTURED);
> It is used to store animals history profile in a vet clinic hospital;


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**


- Open SQL Shell and perform the following query operations
> SELECT * FROM animals;
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '2016/01/01' AND '2019/12/31';
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE neutered=true AND escape_attempts < 3;
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE name='Agumon' OR name='Pikachu';
> SELECT date_of_birth FROM animals WHERE name='Agumon' OR name='Pikachu';
> SELECT name, escape_attempts FROM animals WHERE weight_kg > 10.5;
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE neutered=true;
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE name='Gabumon';
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE NOT name='Gabumon';
> SELECT * FROM animals WHERE weight_kg BETWEEN 10.4 AND 17.3;
